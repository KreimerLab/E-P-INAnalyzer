# E-P-INAnalyzer
E-P-INAnalyzer is a Python-based toolkit for understanding enhancer-promoter interaction networks from RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, and ChIP-Seq datasets. E-P-INAnalzyer allows researchers to reveal substructures, integrate TFs, locate disease-associated variation, and perform enrichment analyses on enhancer-promoter interaction networks (E-P-INs). 

E-P-INAnalzyer can be installed using this GitHub repository: 
```
# Clone E-P-INAnalyzerâ€™ GitHub
git clone https://github.com/KreimerLab/E-P-INAnalyzer.git

# Navigate to E-P-INAnalyzer
cd E-P-INAnalyzer/E-P-INAnalyzer
```

We provided a singular computation framework for a task dependent on Python, R, and Bash. Inputting appropriate datasets, which can be found in GitHub's E-P-INs section, will allow these tasks to run in sequence.
